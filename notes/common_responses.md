Missing Zenodo DOI:

> Have you considered indexing your package on Zenodo? It's a fairly simple process ([step-by-step guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)) and will create a new record on Zenodo for each version that you release on GitHub. This helps people cite the specific version that they use via a DOI and give proper credit to all contributors. It can also be helpful for accurately keeping track of who cites your package.
