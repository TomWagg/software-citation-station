A codebook is developed to support a content analysis of the full-text papers. Our results indicate that the software R and its packages are inconsistently cited, as is the case with other scientific software. The inconsistency derives partly from the variety of citation standards currently used for software, and partly from fact that these standards are not well followed by authors on multiple levels. This work sheds light on the future development of software citation standards, especially given the present landscape of conflicting citation practices. Moreover, our approach furnishes a possible blueprint for dealing with the granularity of software entities in scientific citation: we consider citations of the core R software environment, of specific R packages, and of individual functions.}

abstract = {While several aspects of open research software libraries have been studied, their in-code citation practices remain an unexplored area. In-code citations are citations of published scientific contributions added in the programming source code of research software libraries. In this paper, 73 such libraries are analyzed to determine the availability and consistency of in-code citations and reference sections. Findings indicate that 54 (73.9 %) of these libraries have at least one in-code citation. However, 47 had at least one incomplete citation and 89.3 % of libraries with several citations used multiple formats for citations. For reference sections, 36 of the libraries investigated in this study had at least one section. Still, inconsistencies in formats were also present as 83.3 % of the libraries with two or more sections used multiple formats for the sections, which may prevent automated programmers from indexing and collecting the list of references. Most importantly, this study investigates the availability of a systematic method that allows for the linking of references and in-code citations. Findings indicate that only six of the libraries had such a method, although many did not fully implement the method.}

abstract = {Research increasingly depends on software, yet software work is often relatively invisible to the reputation economy shaping research careers. To address this, we demonstrate CiteAs, a system designed to improve incentives for high-quality software work by altering citation behaviors in the loosely governed sociotechnical system producing research software. CiteAs has two goals: first, to encourage those producing research software to make clear requests for citations most valuable to them; and second, to encourage users of research software to cite software more and follow the citations requested by the developer. CiteAs is implemented as a specialized search engine at https://citeas.org/ that explains itself and instructs better practices. Ultimately we hope that CiteAs will increase the visibility of research software, improving incentives for the software work needed to advance research.},

The next decade will transform our understanding of the universe and humanity's place in it.  Every decade the U.S. agencies that provide primary federal funding for astronomy and astrophysics request a survey to assess the status of, and opportunities for the Nation's efforts to forward our understanding of the cosmos. Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s identifies the most compelling science goals and presents an ambitious program of ground- and space-based activities for future investment in the next decade and beyond.  The decadal survey identifies three important science themes for the next decade aimed at investigating Earth-like extrasolar planets, the most energetic processes in the universe, and the evolution of galaxies.  The Astro2020 report also recommends critical near-term actions to support the foundations of the profession as well as the technologies and tools needed to carry out the science.",  url       = "https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26141/pathways-to-discovery-in-astronomy-and-astrophysics-for-the-2020s",
